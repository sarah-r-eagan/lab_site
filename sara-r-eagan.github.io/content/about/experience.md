The lab used EEG and behavioral methods to investigate face and object perception, holistic processing, and other related effects. In [Dr. Bukach](author/cindy-m.-bukach-phd/)‘s lab, I worked on numerous projects. Most notably, the [PURSUE](http://pursueerp.com) project, where I was able to hone my skills and knowledge of ERP methodology and experimentation."

  description: "  <center>\n  \n  ![](/about/experience_files/bru.jpg) \n  \n  </center>\n  \n  I completed my BSc in Kinesiology at Washington State University (WSU). While at WSU, I took a Sport Psychology course with Dr. Lawrence D. Bruya (lovingly referred to as “Bru”), and became interested in research. After conducting my first research project in class, Bru invited me to work on a research project that needed help getting off the ground. I ended up taking the lead on the project and joining forces with Dr. Hotaka Maeda (then a fellow undergraduate student). Our project was eventually completed and published [Running with Music](link). I eventually went on to complete a second BSc in Psychology (December 2013). After graduating, I took a position as a Psychiatric Childcare Counselor at a mental hospital in Washington State."
