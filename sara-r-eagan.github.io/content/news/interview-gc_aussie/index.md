title: 'Radio Interview: Breakfast with Bern Young'
---

I was contacted by a radio show in Australia, [ABC Gold Coast](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/goldcoast/)‘s "Breakfast with [Bern Young](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/people/bern-young/7951830)” morning show. The interview was focused on how music can improve exercise performance and motivation. In particular, I talked to them about our research study [Effects of Listening to Preferential Music on Sex Differences in Endurance Running Performance](/project/run_w_music/), in addition to what other researchers have found regarding the use of music to motivate people to exercise.
