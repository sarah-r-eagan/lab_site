title: 'Preprint: Classifying Mental State from Eye Movement Data'
---

My collaborative project with Dr. Karl Kuntzelman, [Dr. Mike Dodd](/author/michael-d.-dodd-phd/), and [Dr. Matt Johnson](/author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd/) entitled "Convolutional neural networks can decode eye movement data: A black box approach to predicting task from eye movements" is currently under review, and was posted as a preprint on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/)!
