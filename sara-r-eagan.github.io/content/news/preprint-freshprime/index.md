title: 'Preprint: Probability Manipulations Modulate Reflective Inhibition of Return'
---

My project with [Evan Lintz](/author/evan-n.-lintz/) and [Dr. Matt Johnson](/author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd/) from our lab ([RAP Lab](https://raplab.rocks)) entitled "Probability manipulations can modulate but not reverse reflective inhibition of return effects" is currently under review, and was posted as a preprint on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/)!
