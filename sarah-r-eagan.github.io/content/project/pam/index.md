title: The Use and Perceptions of Physical Activity Monitors
---

In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up doors and windows for enhancing the human experience. In the same period, we have seen a growing concern for personal health and wellness. As such, physical activity monitors (PAMs) – most commonly wristbands or phone apps – have become a popular tool for individuals to self-monitor physical activity and set goals. At this point, there is not a lot of information regarding the use of PAMs. For this reason, [Dr. Darrell Butler](/author/darrell-l.-butler-phd/) and I conducted focus groups and large-scale surveys of PAM users to better understand their motivation for purchasing and using PAMs, in addition to observing the outcomes individuals with PAMs experience as a result of using the PAMs.
