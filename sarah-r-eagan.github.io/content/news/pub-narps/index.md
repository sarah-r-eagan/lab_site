I was recently involved with [Dr. Matt Johnson](/author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd/), [Evan Lintz](/author/evan-n.-lintz/), [Josh Zosky](/author/joshua-e.-zosky/) and other lab members on a large-scale multi-lab research project that was concerned with comparing fMRI data analysis pipelines between numerous research labs. For me, this project was my first experience analyzing fMRI data (I have since been involved in multiple other fMRI projects - stay tuned!). With the guidance of [Dr. Johnson](/author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd), I contributed to the processing, analysis, and reporting of our findings. The results from our lab (and many others) were collated by the central group running the project. The different reports were analyzed to determine how decisions were made at various points of the analyses, and how these decisions affected the reported outcome of the analysis. While findings reported from fMRI and othere complex analyses are often taken as relatively objective, this study brings to light the importance of open science and replication.
