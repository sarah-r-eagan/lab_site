Hello! My name is Dr. Sarah Eagan! I am an Assistant Professor at Worcester State University. In my research, I use theories from social psychology, feminism, public health, and women’s, gender, and sexuality studies to answer two related questions in my program of research: 1) when and why is SV perpetrated by men, and 2) what are the consequences of SV for victims? Since I hold that similar processes underlie different types of SV (Gervais & Eagan, 2017), I examine these questions in multiple ways including sexual assault, uninvited sexual attention, and sexual harassment. My methodological approach is multi-pronged, as I use quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. In addition to generating new knowledge, I am committed to sharing that knowledge to facilitate social justice and guide policymakers and practitioners with empirically-based actions that are survivor-focused and trauma-informed.  


My teaching phiolophy is shaped by my identies as an academic, Latina, and Queer woman, where my own marginalized identities shape my motivation to create a safe and welcoming learning space for others with visible and invisible marginalized identities. This means creating a learning space where all identities can thrive. I create a learning space where marginalized identities can emerge at the forefront so that their voices are amplified and heard. At the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, I used this approach not only in the courses that I taught (see vita) but out of the classroom in my mentoring of undergraduates. I create an inclusive and anti-racist learning space in three ways: 1) by decolonizing the course content and materials, 2) creating an inclusive classroom space, and 3) extending these equitable efforts outside the classroom in my inclusive mentorship.
