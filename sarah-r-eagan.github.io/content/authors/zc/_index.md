I am a Ph. D. student in the Neuroscience and Behavior program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I work in Dr. Matthew R. Johnsonâ€˜s [Reflection, Attention, and Perception (RAP) research lab](http://matthewrjohnson.net).

I am interested in merging my backgrounds in Kinesiology and Psychology by exploring the cognitive and physiological aspects of neural plasticity with regard to improving mental function. To this end, I am working to build a research program that uses fMRI, EEG, eye tracking, and deep learning methods to investigate the interaction between health, exercise, and executive function. In particular, I am interested in how this interaction plays out in perceptual (i.e., when attention is focused externally) and reflective (i.e., when attention is focused in working memory) domains.
